AIonDemand documentation!
===================================

The European AI-on-demand Platform seeks to bring together the AI community while promoting European values. The platform is a facilitator of knowledge transfer from research to multiple business domains. 

The platform serves as a catalyst to aid AI-based innovation, resulting in new products, services, and solutions to benefit European industry, commerce, and society. By bringing people together, the community resource seeks to address the fragmentation of the European AI landscape and facilitate technology transfer from research to business. 

The AI on Demand aims to create value, growth, and jobs in Europe through an ecosystem and a collaborative platform that unites the AI community, promotes European values, and supports research on human-centered and trustworthy AI. 

Initiated in 2019 with the support of the European Commission, the platform will continue to develop over the coming years through further investment that will see the platform add additional services and tools.
