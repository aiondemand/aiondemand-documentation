Understanding the User Interface
==========

Accessing the AI-on-demand Platform through the EU login
------------------------
To fully benefit from the platform’s services, 
such as the Experimentation service or to add 
content to the platform through the `Collaboration <https://www.ai4europe.eu/collaboration>`_,
page you must log on to the platform with the `EU login
<https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/cas/login?loginRequestId=ECAS_LR-16714259->`_,
which is the European Commission's single sign-on user authentication service. Using the Experiments service as an authenticated user, for example, allows you to upload AI resources such as data or models and create your own AI solutions. 
The EU login allows you to access to a wide range of web services, using a single email address and password. The EU login is manufacturer-independent and has more than 6 million active users from the European Commission, EU institutions and agencies as well as external users. It is quick and easy to create an EU login account. Alternatively, you can gain access via selected social media accounts.

If you already possess a login for the platform, we recommend using the same email address for the new EU login procedure. Your email address serves as identifier to seamlessly map your account. In this way, you can get a quick overview of your past contributions, such as the resources you already uploaded.

To sign in to the platform follow these simple steps:

1. If you do not already have an EU login you may create an account `here <https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/cas>`_
